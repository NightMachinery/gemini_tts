# PODCAST TRANSCRIPT: "Gaming, Mood, and the Slippery Slope"
## A Dialogue Between Dr. Jeffrey Young and Dr. Steven Hayes

---

**[INTRO MUSIC: Soft, contemplative piano fades in and out]**

DR. STEVEN HAYES: Welcome, everyone. I'm Steven Hayes, and today I have the great pleasure of speaking with my colleague Dr. Jeffrey Young. Jeff, of course, is the founder of Schema Therapy, and we're going to dive into something that I think many of our listeners will relate to – the experience of getting caught in patterns where we tell ourselves that one activity will help our mood, and then we can get back to what needs doing. Specifically, we're looking at a case where someone is fusing with the thought that playing Civilization VI will improve their mood, after which they believe they can return to their backlog of chores. Jeff, welcome.

DR. JEFFREY YOUNG: Thank you, Steve. It's always a pleasure to explore these everyday struggles that really capture something profound about human psychology. This particular issue – using gaming or any pleasurable activity as a mood regulation strategy before tackling responsibilities – it's something I see variations of constantly in my practice.

DR. STEVEN HAYES: [chuckles] And it's something I suspect we've both experienced ourselves in different forms. Before we dive in, I want to mention that we'll also be exploring an interesting concept from the rationalist community about "Schelling fences on slippery slopes" – essentially, how we set boundaries when each small step seems reasonable but the endpoint is problematic.

DR. JEFFREY YOUNG: That's fascinating, and it really speaks to what happens in schema modes. When someone is in an Avoidant Protector mode, for instance, each incremental decision to avoid seems protective and reasonable in the moment.

DR. STEVEN HAYES: Exactly. So let's start with the basic scenario. Someone has chores to do – let's say dishes, laundry, maybe some work tasks – and they're sitting there with this thought: "I'll feel better if I play some Civ VI first, then I'll be in a better headspace to tackle these tasks." From an ACT perspective, there are several processes happening here. The first and perhaps most central is cognitive fusion.

DR. JEFFREY YOUNG: And from a schema therapy lens, I'm immediately curious about what schemas might be activated. Is this someone with an Insufficient Self-Control schema? Or perhaps they have an Unrelenting Standards schema that makes the chores feel overwhelming, triggering a Detached Protector mode where they disconnect through gaming?

DR. STEVEN HAYES: That's a great point about the overwhelming nature of the tasks. In ACT, we'd look at this as experiential avoidance – the chores come with uncomfortable feelings, maybe anxiety, maybe a sense of inadequacy, maybe just plain boredom or frustration. The mind offers this solution: "Play the game first, feel better, then do the chores." But notice what's happening – we're buying into the idea that we need to feel different before we can act.

DR. JEFFREY YOUNG: Yes, and this is where I see the Coping Surrender mode often appearing. The person essentially gives up and seeks immediate gratification because the healthy adult part of them that could tackle the chores feels too weak or overwhelmed. They're not just avoiding the chores; they're avoiding the feelings that come with facing their responsibilities.

DR. STEVEN HAYES: [TIME ~ 00:05:00] And here's where the Schelling fence concept becomes really relevant. The article describes something called "Murder-Gandhi" – a thought experiment where Gandhi is offered a pill that makes him 1% less reluctant to murder. He might take it thinking "I'm still 99% as peaceful as before," but then 99%-Gandhi might take another pill, and so on, until you have a Gandhi rampaging through the streets.

DR. JEFFREY YOUNG: [laughs] That's quite an image! But it's perfect for understanding how these patterns develop. Each time someone chooses gaming over chores, they're taking that "1% pill." They become slightly more comfortable with avoidance, slightly more convinced that they need the mood boost first.

DR. STEVEN HAYES: Precisely. And the slippery slope here is clear. Today it's "I'll play for 30 minutes to improve my mood." Tomorrow it becomes an hour. Next week, the entire afternoon is gone. The person might even develop elaborate justifications – "I'm more creative after gaming," or "I work better under pressure anyway, so I'll do the chores later when I have to."

DR. JEFFREY YOUNG: In schema therapy, we call this the "permission-giving thoughts" that maintain maladaptive coping. The person develops a whole narrative structure to support the avoidance. What's particularly interesting is that these thoughts often have a kernel of truth – maybe they do sometimes feel energized after gaming – but it becomes overextended and rigid.

DR. STEVEN HAYES: Right, and from an ACT standpoint, the problem isn't necessarily the gaming itself. Gaming can be a perfectly valid choice. The problem is when it's driven by fusion with the thought "I need to feel better first" and when it moves us away from our values. If someone values being responsible, maintaining their living space, or being productive, then this pattern is actually taking them away from what matters to them.

DR. JEFFREY YOUNG: I want to add something here about the schema perspective on values. Often, when someone is chronically avoiding responsibilities through activities like gaming, there's an underlying belief system at work. They might have an Entitlement schema – "I shouldn't have to do things that are boring or unpleasant." Or there might be a Dependence/Incompetence schema – "I can't handle these tasks without being in the perfect mental state."

DR. STEVEN HAYES: [TIME ~ 00:08:30] Those schemas you're describing sound like they create their own form of cognitive fusion. The person isn't just fused with the thought about needing to game first; they're fused with these deeper beliefs about themselves and what they can or can't handle.

DR. JEFFREY YOUNG: Exactly. And here's where the schema mode model becomes really useful. When the person is sitting there, looking at the chores and turning toward the game, they might be in a Vulnerable Child mode – feeling small and overwhelmed. The gaming then becomes the Detached Protector's solution – "Don't feel, just escape into the game world."

DR. STEVEN HAYES: In ACT, we'd invite the person to notice this whole sequence mindfully. What does that vulnerable feeling actually feel like in the body? Can you make room for it without immediately trying to change it? And then – here's the key part – can you take a small step toward your values even while that discomfort is present?

DR. JEFFREY YOUNG: That's similar to what we do in schema therapy with mode work. We'd help the person recognize when they're in that Vulnerable Child mode and work on developing their Healthy Adult mode – the part that can acknowledge the discomfort but still make choices aligned with long-term wellbeing.

DR. STEVEN HAYES: Let's talk more about this slippery slope concept. The article mentions something really important – that sometimes the best solution is to establish what they call a "Schelling point" – an arbitrary but clear boundary that you pre-commit to defending. For instance, "I will not turn on any game until I've completed at least one full chore."

DR. JEFFREY YOUNG: That's brilliant, and it aligns perfectly with what we do in schema therapy when we work on developing healthy limits. The problem is, the person in the moment doesn't trust their future self to stick to the boundary. If they say "I'll game for 30 minutes," they know that 30-minutes-into-gaming self will want to continue.

DR. STEVEN HAYES: [TIME ~ 00:11:45] Yes! This is what the article calls "hyperbolic discounting." The next ten minutes of gaming feel incredibly valuable, but the consequences an hour from now feel abstract and unimportant. It's like each moment creates its own little tyranny over our future selves.

DR. JEFFREY YOUNG: From a schema therapy perspective, this is where we need to strengthen the Healthy Adult mode beforehand. When you're not in the heat of the moment, when you're not being pulled by the immediate desire to game, that's when you establish these boundaries. You might even write yourself a letter from your Healthy Adult to your future Vulnerable Child.

DR. STEVEN HAYES: I love that idea of writing to your future self. In ACT, we might frame it as connecting with your values and making a commitment. Not because you have to, not because you should, but because this is the person you want to be. And then we practice defusion techniques for when that thought arises: "I need to game first to feel better."

DR. JEFFREY YOUNG: Can you walk us through one of those defusion techniques for this specific situation?

DR. STEVEN HAYES: Sure. So let's say the thought arises: "Playing Civ VI will improve my mood, then I can do chores." First, we might simply notice it as a thought. "I'm having the thought that playing Civ VI will improve my mood." Already, there's a little space there. Then we might play with it further: "I'm noticing that I'm having the thought that playing Civ VI will improve my mood." Or we might thank our mind: "Thanks, mind, for that gaming suggestion. I see you're trying to help me feel better."

DR. JEFFREY YOUNG: That's creating distance from the thought without fighting it. In schema therapy, we might do something similar but frame it as recognizing which mode is speaking. "Oh, that's my Detached Protector talking. It wants to help me avoid discomfort."

DR. STEVEN HAYES: [TIME ~ 00:14:30] Exactly. And here's something crucial – we're not arguing with the thought. We're not saying "No, gaming won't improve your mood." Because it might! The point is that we're choosing based on our values, not based on our mood or our mind's predictions about our mood.

DR. JEFFREY YOUNG: This brings up an important point about schema chemistry, as I call it. When someone has been using gaming or any activity as their primary mood regulation strategy for a long time, their brain chemistry has adapted to expect that dopamine hit. Breaking the pattern isn't just about willpower; it's about recognizing that there will be a period of discomfort as the brain readjusts.

DR. STEVEN HAYES: That's such an important point. In ACT, we call this "creative hopelessness" – recognizing that the strategies we've been using to avoid discomfort are actually creating more problems. The gaming-for-mood-improvement strategy might work in the very short term, but what's the long-term cost?

DR. JEFFREY YOUNG: The long-term cost is huge. The chores pile up, creating more stress. The person feels worse about themselves for procrastinating. They might even develop a narrative about being lazy or incompetent, which feeds right back into those schemas we discussed earlier.

DR. STEVEN HAYES: And here's where the slippery slope gets really slippery. Because now they need even more mood improvement to face the even larger pile of chores. So maybe one game session isn't enough anymore. Maybe they need two hours, or three, or the whole day.

DR. JEFFREY YOUNG: [TIME ~ 00:17:00] It becomes what I call a schema maintenance cycle. The avoidance confirms the belief that they can't handle discomfort, which makes them more likely to avoid in the future, which creates more evidence for the belief. It's self-perpetuating.

DR. STEVEN HAYES: Let's bring in another concept from the Schelling fence article. It talks about how slippery slopes can exist when a policy doesn't just affect the world directly, but affects people's willingness or ability to oppose future policies. In our gaming example, each choice to game instead of doing chores doesn't just delay the chores – it affects the person's future willingness to choose chores over gaming.

DR. JEFFREY YOUNG: That's profound. It's not just about this one decision today. It's about what kind of person you're becoming through repeated decisions. In schema therapy, we talk about this as strengthening either adaptive or maladaptive modes. Each time you give in to the Detached Protector, it gets stronger. Each time you act from your Healthy Adult, that gets stronger.

DR. STEVEN HAYES: And this is why the commitment needs to be made when you're not in the heat of the moment. The article talks about someone playing Civilization at midnight, knowing they have work tomorrow. At midnight, the next ten minutes of gaming feel crucial. But if they had decided at 8 PM that midnight was their hard stop, they have a fighting chance.

DR. JEFFREY YOUNG: In schema therapy, we might even rehearse this scenario. We'd have the person imagine being at that choice point – it's midnight, the game is calling, but you've committed to stop. We'd work through what modes might get activated and how to respond from the Healthy Adult.

DR. STEVEN HAYES: [TIME ~ 00:20:00] That behavioral rehearsal is so important. In ACT, we might also work with the person on what we call "committed action" – taking steps toward your values even when your mind and emotions are screaming at you to do something else. It's not about winning the war with your thoughts and feelings; it's about changing your relationship with them.

DR. JEFFREY YOUNG: I want to circle back to something about the specific thought: "Playing Civ VI will improve my mood." There's an assumption embedded there that's worth examining – the assumption that we need to be in a good mood to do chores. Where does that come from?

DR. STEVEN HAYES: That's the million-dollar question, isn't it? From an ACT perspective, this is a fundamental misconception about how humans work. We've been sold this idea that we need to feel motivated to act, feel confident to take risks, feel happy to engage with life. But that's not how it works. Often, action comes first, and the feelings follow.

DR. JEFFREY YOUNG: And from a developmental perspective, this might link back to early experiences. Maybe as a child, this person learned that they could only get things done when they were in the "right" mood. Maybe they had a parent who modeled this – "I can't deal with this right now, I'm too stressed." Or maybe they were only asked to help with chores when they seemed happy and willing.

DR. STEVEN HAYES: That developmental piece is so important. These patterns don't come from nowhere. But here's what I find hopeful – regardless of where the pattern came from, we can change our relationship with it right now, in this moment.

DR. JEFFREY YOUNG: [TIME ~ 00:22:45] Yes, though I'd add that understanding the origin can help with self-compassion. If someone recognizes that they learned this pattern as a child, they can be gentler with themselves as they work to change it. It's not a character flaw; it's a learned pattern that made sense at one time.

DR. STEVEN HAYES: Absolutely. Self-compassion is crucial here. And speaking of patterns that made sense at one time, let's talk about what gaming might actually be doing for this person beyond just mood improvement. What needs might it be meeting?

DR. JEFFREY YOUNG: Great question. Gaming, especially a game like Civilization, provides a sense of control, achievement, progress – all things that might feel lacking when facing a pile of mundane chores. In schema terms, it might be compensating for feelings of inadequacy or failure in real life.

DR. STEVEN HAYES: It's predictable, too. You know that if you play Civ VI, you'll make progress in your game. You'll build cities, advance through ages, win battles. The chores? They'll just need doing again tomorrow. There's no epic victory in doing dishes.

DR. JEFFREY YOUNG: Exactly. And this is where we need to help people find meaning in the mundane. In schema therapy, we might explore how taking care of your living space is actually an act of self-care, a way of nurturing yourself that the Vulnerable Child inside really needs.

DR. STEVEN HAYES: In ACT, we'd connect it to values. Maybe you value being a responsible person. Maybe you value creating a peaceful, organized environment. Maybe you value modeling good habits for others in your life. The dishes themselves aren't the point – it's about who you're being when you do them.

DR. JEFFREY YOUNG: [TIME ~ 00:25:30] Let me share a technique we use in schema therapy that might be helpful here. We call it "pros and cons with mode awareness." The person lists the pros and cons of gaming versus doing chores, but they identify which mode is speaking for each item. So "Pro of gaming: It's fun and relaxing" might be coming from the Happy Child mode. "Con of gaming: The chores will pile up" might be from the Healthy Adult.

DR. STEVEN HAYES: That's brilliant because it makes the internal dialogue visible. In ACT, we might do something similar with values and actions. We'd ask: "If you game for the next hour, what values are you moving toward? What values are you moving away from? And same question for doing the chores."

DR. JEFFREY YOUNG: And here's where it gets interesting – gaming might actually align with some values. Maybe creativity, or strategic thinking, or even relaxation and self-care. The problem isn't gaming itself; it's when gaming becomes the only way to meet those needs, or when it's done at the expense of other important values.

DR. STEVEN HAYES: Right. This isn't about demonizing gaming or any pleasurable activity. It's about conscious choice. Are you choosing to game because it aligns with your values in this moment? Or are you gaming because you're avoiding discomfort?

DR. JEFFREY YOUNG: That distinction is crucial. In schema therapy, we'd say: Are you gaming from your Happy Child mode – genuinely enjoying it as part of a balanced life? Or are you gaming from your Detached Protector mode – using it to avoid and disconnect?

DR. STEVEN HAYES: [TIME ~ 00:28:00] Let's dive deeper into this slippery slope concept. The article mentions different types of slippery slopes. One is where you lose the ability to make future decisions – like if you give up privacy rights, you might not be able to organize resistance to tyranny later. How does this apply to our gaming scenario?

DR. JEFFREY YOUNG: Well, each time someone chooses gaming over responsibilities, they're potentially weakening their ability to make different choices in the future. Not because they literally can't choose differently, but because the pattern becomes more entrenched, the neural pathways deeper, the habit stronger.

DR. STEVEN HAYES: And there's a social component too. If someone consistently games instead of doing chores, others in their life might start compensating – doing their chores for them, not expecting them to contribute. This removes natural consequences that might otherwise motivate change.

DR. JEFFREY YOUNG: That's enabling, and it's a huge problem. In schema therapy, we work with partners and family members to stop reinforcing maladaptive patterns. If your partner always does the dishes because you're gaming, where's the incentive to change?

DR. STEVEN HAYES: This brings us to another type of slippery slope from the article – where each step changes your values or your assessment of future steps. The person who games instead of doing chores today might tomorrow think, "Well, I gamed yesterday and the world didn't end. Why not today too?"

DR. JEFFREY YOUNG: [TIME ~ 00:30:45] Yes, and this is where schemas really show their power. Each time you act from a schema, it seems to confirm the schema's truth. "I avoided the chores and felt better – see, I really can't handle discomfort." It's confirmation bias in action.

DR. STEVEN HAYES: In ACT, we talk about this as the problem of experiential avoidance. The more you avoid, the more you need to avoid. It's like building tolerance to a drug – you need higher and higher doses of avoidance to get the same relief.

DR. JEFFREY YOUNG: And just like with substance tolerance, there's a withdrawal period when you stop. When someone who's been avoiding through gaming suddenly tries to face their responsibilities, they might experience intense anxiety, restlessness, even physical discomfort.

DR. STEVEN HAYES: Which their mind will interpret as evidence that they really do need to game first! "See how terrible you feel? You definitely need to improve your mood before tackling these chores."

DR. JEFFREY YOUNG: This is where the therapist's role becomes crucial. We need to help people understand that this discomfort is temporary and, more importantly, survivable. In schema therapy, we might use imagery to help the person visualize getting through the discomfort and coming out the other side.

DR. STEVEN HAYES: [TIME ~ 00:33:00] In ACT, we use willingness exercises. We might ask, "On a scale of 0 to 10, how willing are you to feel anxious for the next 20 minutes if it means getting your dishes done?" We're not asking them to like it or want it, just to be willing to have it.

DR. JEFFREY YOUNG: That's powerful because it shifts from "I can't handle this" to "I'm choosing whether to handle this." It puts the person back in the driver's seat, even if the ride is uncomfortable.

DR. STEVEN HAYES: Let's talk about practical strategies. Someone's sitting there right now, they have chores to do, and their mind is saying, "Just one quick game of Civ VI first." What do they do?

DR. JEFFREY YOUNG: First, recognize what's happening. Name it. "I'm at a choice point. My Detached Protector wants me to game. My Vulnerable Child feels overwhelmed by the chores. What would my Healthy Adult do?"

DR. STEVEN HAYES: And from an ACT perspective, I'd add: Notice the thought without judgment. "There's that gaming thought again. Thanks, mind." Then connect with your body. Feel your feet on the floor, your breath moving in and out. This grounds you in the present moment, not in your mind's predictions about the future.

DR. JEFFREY YOUNG: [TIME ~ 00:35:30] I'd also suggest what we call "mode dialogue." Have your Healthy Adult talk to your Vulnerable Child. "I know the chores feel overwhelming. We don't have to do them all. Let's just start with one small thing. I'll be with you the whole time."

DR. STEVEN HAYES: That internal compassion is so important. In ACT, we might use the metaphor of being a good parent to yourself. A good parent doesn't let their child eat candy for dinner just because the child doesn't feel like eating vegetables. But they also don't shame the child for wanting candy.

DR. JEFFREY YOUNG: Exactly. It's about firm but loving limits. And here's a practical tip: Start with the smallest, easiest chore. Build momentum. Success breeds success.

DR. STEVEN HAYES: Or use what I call "the 2-minute rule." Commit to just 2 minutes of chores. That's all. Often, starting is the hardest part, and once you're in motion, it's easier to continue. But even if you stop after 2 minutes, you've broken the avoidance pattern.

DR. JEFFREY YOUNG: We have something similar in schema therapy called "graded task assignment." Start with something so small that your Vulnerable Child can handle it. Maybe it's just putting one dish in the dishwasher. Then celebrate that success, no matter how small.

DR. STEVEN HAYES: [TIME ~ 00:38:00] And here's where the Schelling fence concept becomes really practical. You need to decide on your boundary before you're in the situation. Maybe it's "No gaming before 7 PM" or "Gaming only after all dishes are done" or "Sunday morning is for chores, Sunday afternoon is for gaming."

DR. JEFFREY YOUNG: The key is making it clear and non-negotiable. In schema therapy, we might even write a contract with yourself. Sign it when you're in Healthy Adult mode. Then when the temptation arises, you can refer back to this contract you made with yourself.

DR. STEVEN HAYES: I want to address something important here. Some people might be thinking, "But what if I really do perform better when I'm in a good mood? What if gaming genuinely helps me?" And you know what? Maybe it does, sometimes. But here's the question: Is it working for you overall? Is this pattern moving you toward the life you want?

DR. JEFFREY YOUNG: That's the pragmatic question. In schema therapy, we'd look at the life pattern. Is this person generally keeping up with their responsibilities? Are their relationships suffering? Is their living space chaotic? If the answer to these questions suggests a problem, then the "gaming improves my mood" strategy isn't working, regardless of how true it feels in the moment.

DR. STEVEN HAYES: [TIME ~ 00:40:45] And let's be honest about what "improves my mood" really means here. Does gaming make you genuinely happy and fulfilled? Or does it just numb you out, help you forget about the stress for a while?

DR. JEFFREY YOUNG: That's a crucial distinction. In schema therapy, we differentiate between healthy pleasure – which leaves you feeling genuinely good about yourself – and avoidant pleasure – which might feel good in the moment but leaves you with regret, shame, or increased stress afterward.

DR. STEVEN HAYES: In ACT terms, we'd ask: Is this moving you toward vitality or away from it? Vitality isn't just about feeling good; it's about feeling fully alive, engaged, present to your life – even the difficult parts.

DR. JEFFREY YOUNG: Let me share a case example, with details changed for privacy, of course. I had a client who would spend entire weekends gaming while his apartment became increasingly chaotic. He told himself he was "recharging" for the work week. But Monday would come, and he'd feel worse – guilty about the wasted weekend, stressed about the messy apartment, disconnected from friends he'd ignored.

DR. STEVEN HAYES: What was the turning point for him?

DR. JEFFREY YOUNG: [TIME ~ 00:43:00] We did an exercise where he imagined himself at 80, looking back on his life. I asked him to describe what he saw. He broke down crying because he realized he was imagining thousands of hours of gaming and very few real memories, real connections, real accomplishments. It was a powerful moment of connecting with his Vulnerable Child's deep need for a meaningful life.

DR. STEVEN HAYES: That's beautiful and heartbreaking at the same time. In ACT, we do something similar called the "tombstone exercise" or "eulogy exercise." What do you want people to say about you when you're gone? "He reached level 99 in every game he played" or "He was there for the people he loved, he took care of his responsibilities, he lived according to his values"?

DR. JEFFREY YOUNG: And it's not about shaming. It's about clarity. Once you're clear on what really matters to you, the choices become easier. Not easy, but easier.

DR. STEVEN HAYES: Let's talk about the social aspect of this. The article mentions something called "coalitions of resistance" – how different groups might band together to defend a Schelling point. How might this apply to our gaming scenario?

DR. JEFFREY YOUNG: Well, imagine if our gamer connected with others who are trying to balance gaming with responsibilities. They could support each other, hold each other accountable. "We all game, but we all commit to doing our chores first."

DR. STEVEN HAYES: [TIME ~ 00:45:30] That's the power of community. In ACT, we often encourage people to share their commitments with others. Not for shame or external pressure, but for support and accountability. Tell your roommate, "I'm committed to doing dishes before gaming. If you see me gaming with dishes in the sink, please remind me of my commitment."

DR. JEFFREY YOUNG: In schema therapy groups, we do something similar. Group members will call each other out – lovingly – when they see someone slipping into a maladaptive mode. "Hey, that sounds like your Detached Protector talking. What would your Healthy Adult say?"

DR. STEVEN HAYES: The article also mentions that slippery slopes can slip both ways. If we start being too rigid about never gaming before chores, could that create its own problems?

DR. JEFFREY YOUNG: Absolutely. In schema therapy, we see this with people who have Unrelenting Standards schemas. They become so rigid about productivity that they can't ever relax or enjoy themselves. The Punitive Parent mode takes over, and any moment of pleasure becomes a source of guilt.

DR. STEVEN HAYES: Right. The goal isn't to become a productivity robot. It's to make conscious choices aligned with your values. Sometimes, choosing to game instead of doing chores might be the values-aligned choice – maybe you've had an incredibly stressful day and genuine self-care is what's needed.

DR. JEFFREY YOUNG: [TIME ~ 00:48:00] The key word there is "conscious." Are you choosing from awareness, or are you running on autopilot? Are you choosing from your Healthy Adult, or is a maladaptive mode making the choice for you?

DR. STEVEN HAYES: Let's dig into the specific thought again: "Playing Civ VI will improve my mood, after which I can go back to my backlog of chores." There's a timeline implied here. Play first, then chores. What if we flipped it?

DR. JEFFREY YOUNG: "I'll do one chore, then reassess how I feel." This breaks the all-or-nothing thinking. You don't have to do all the chores. You don't have to game for hours. You can take it one step at a time.

DR. STEVEN HAYES: And notice how different that feels in your body. "I have to do all these chores" probably creates tension, heaviness, resistance. "I'll do one dish" might feel lighter, more manageable.

DR. JEFFREY YOUNG: In schema therapy, we call this "chunking down." The Vulnerable Child can't handle "clean the entire apartment," but it might be able to handle "put the cereal bowl in the dishwasher."

DR. STEVEN HAYES: [TIME ~ 00:50:30] There's also something important about the order of operations. When you do a chore first, then game, the gaming feels different. It's a reward, not an escape. It's chosen, not compulsive.

DR. JEFFREY YOUNG: Yes! And neurologically, this makes a difference. When gaming is a reward for completed tasks, it reinforces the task completion. When gaming is an escape from tasks, it reinforces the avoidance. Same activity, completely different psychological and neurological impact.

DR. STEVEN HAYES: The article talks about commitment devices – ways to lock yourself into good behavior. What might that look like here?

DR. JEFFREY YOUNG: Practical things like using website blockers during designated chore times. Or more creatively, you could give your gaming mouse to your roommate and only get it back after showing completed chores.

DR. STEVEN HAYES: Or use what I call "environmental design." Make the chores easier to start than the gaming. Keep cleaning supplies visible and easily accessible. Put the gaming computer in another room, so you have to make a conscious choice to go to it.

DR. JEFFREY YOUNG: [TIME ~ 00:53:00] These external structures are like training wheels for your Healthy Adult mode. Eventually, you won't need them, but they're incredibly helpful while you're building new patterns.

DR. STEVEN HAYES: Let's talk about what happens when someone fails. Because they will. They'll commit to doing chores first, and then find themselves three hours into a gaming session with nothing done. What then?

DR. JEFFREY YOUNG: This is crucial. In schema therapy, we anticipate relapses. We tell clients, "You will slip back into old modes. That's not failure; it's part of the process." The key is how you respond to the slip.

DR. STEVEN HAYES: In ACT, we talk about this as "falling off the horse." The question isn't whether you'll fall – you will. The question is how quickly you get back on. And more importantly, do you beat yourself up while you're on the ground, or do you treat yourself with compassion and curiosity?

DR. JEFFREY YOUNG: The Punitive Parent mode loves these moments. "See? You're lazy. You're worthless. You can't even do simple chores." But that self-attack just drives more avoidance. It's a vicious cycle.

DR. STEVEN HAYES: [TIME ~ 00:55:30] Exactly. Self-attack doesn't lead to behavior change; it leads to more avoidance. Instead, we need curiosity. "Hmm, I planned to do chores but ended up gaming. What was happening for me in that moment? What can I learn from this?"

DR. JEFFREY YOUNG: And from a schema therapy perspective, we'd explore which modes were active. "Was your Vulnerable Child feeling particularly overwhelmed? Was your Detached Protector especially strong today? What triggered these modes?"

DR. STEVEN HAYES: This curiosity, this willingness to explore without judgment – it's transformative. It turns failures into learning opportunities, setbacks into data.

DR. JEFFREY YOUNG: I want to circle back to the mood question. The thought is "Gaming will improve my mood." Let's grant that it's true. Gaming does improve mood. So what? Why is mood improvement the primary goal?

DR. STEVEN HAYES: That's the heart of it, isn't it? We've become a culture obsessed with feeling good all the time. But constant happiness isn't natural, isn't possible, and the pursuit of it creates suffering.

DR. JEFFREY YOUNG: [TIME ~ 00:58:00] In schema therapy, we see this as the Demanding Parent mode sometimes – "You should be happy! You should be motivated! You should feel good!" But life includes the full spectrum of emotions.

DR. STEVEN HAYES: And here's the paradox – when we stop chasing good feelings and avoiding bad ones, when we accept the full range of human experience, we often end up feeling better overall. Not happy all the time, but more at peace, more vital, more alive.

DR. JEFFREY YOUNG: There's also something about accomplishment and self-efficacy. When you push through the resistance and do the chores, even though you don't feel like it, you build evidence that you're capable. That's a different kind of mood improvement than what gaming provides.

DR. STEVEN HAYES: It's earned versus given. The mood boost from gaming is passive – the game gives it to you. The mood boost from completing tasks is active – you created it through your actions.

DR. JEFFREY YOUNG: And which one lasts longer? The gaming mood boost fades as soon as you turn off the game and face the still-undone chores. The accomplishment boost can last for days.

DR. STEVEN HAYES: [TIME ~ 01:00:30] Let's talk about meaning-making. How do we help someone find meaning in mundane chores?

DR. JEFFREY YOUNG: In schema therapy, we might explore what a clean, organized space represents. For the Vulnerable Child, it might represent safety, being cared for. For the Healthy Adult, it might represent competence and self-respect.

DR. STEVEN HAYES: In ACT, we'd connect it to values and to the kind of person you want to be. Every action is a vote for who you're becoming. When you do the dishes, you're voting for being someone who takes care of their space, who follows through on responsibilities.

DR. JEFFREY YOUNG: There's also a mindfulness component. Can you be fully present while doing dishes? Can you notice the warm water, the soap bubbles, the transformation from dirty to clean? When we're fully present, even mundane tasks can become almost meditative.

DR. STEVEN HAYES: That's beautiful. And it's such a different experience from rushing through chores to get to gaming, or gaming to avoid chores. It's being fully present to your life, even the ordinary parts.

DR. JEFFREY YOUNG: [TIME ~ 01:03:00] Especially the ordinary parts. Life is mostly ordinary moments. If we're only present for the peak experiences, we're missing most of our lives.

DR. STEVEN HAYES: Let me share something from the article about "hyperbolic discounting." It's the tendency to value immediate rewards much more highly than future rewards. The ten minutes of gaming right now feel more valuable than the clean apartment an hour from now.

DR. JEFFREY YOUNG: This is hardwired into our brains. From an evolutionary perspective, the immediate berry in front of you was more valuable than the maybe-berries in the next valley. But in modern life, this wiring works against us.

DR. STEVEN HAYES: So how do we work with this tendency rather than against it? One way is to make the future consequences more immediate and vivid. Instead of "I should do chores," try visualizing yourself tonight, lying in bed in a clean room, feeling peaceful and accomplished.

DR. JEFFREY YOUNG: Or visualize the alternative – lying in bed surrounded by mess, feeling guilty and stressed, unable to sleep because you're thinking about everything you didn't do. Make it visceral, real.

DR. STEVEN HAYES: [TIME ~ 01:05:30] The article also talks about how certain points become "Schelling points" – natural boundaries that are easier to defend. Midnight is a Schelling point. "After dinner" is a Schelling point. "Before any gaming" is a Schelling point.

DR. JEFFREY YOUNG: The clearer and more obvious the boundary, the easier it is to defend. "I'll do chores when I feel like it" is not a Schelling point. "I'll do chores every Saturday morning from 9 to 11" is.

DR. STEVEN HAYES: And once you establish these points, you defend them fiercely. Not because the specific timing matters so much, but because once you let one boundary fall, they all become vulnerable.

DR. JEFFREY YOUNG: This is why consistency is so important in schema therapy. Every time you act from your Healthy Adult mode, you're reinforcing that mode. Every time you give in to a maladaptive mode, you're reinforcing that. There's no neutral ground.

DR. STEVEN HAYES: Let's address the elephant in the room – what if someone's gaming is actually an addiction? What if this isn't just procrastination but something more serious?

DR. JEFFREY YOUNG: [TIME ~ 01:08:00] That's an important distinction. In schema therapy, we'd look at the overall impact on functioning. Is the person maintaining relationships? Keeping their job? Taking care of basic needs? If gaming is significantly impairing major life areas, we're dealing with something beyond simple avoidance.

DR. STEVEN HAYES: And in that case, the strategies we're discussing might not be enough. Professional help might be needed. Gaming addiction is real, and it requires specialized treatment.

DR. JEFFREY YOUNG: But even in cases of addiction, the principles we're discussing apply. The person still needs to learn to tolerate discomfort, to act according to values rather than impulses, to strengthen their capacity for conscious choice.

DR. STEVEN HAYES: Absolutely. The work is similar, just more intensive and probably requiring more support.

DR. JEFFREY YOUNG: I want to share one more technique from schema therapy. We call it "flash cards." The person writes cards with messages from their Healthy Adult to read when they're at a choice point. Things like "You don't need to feel good to do good" or "This discomfort is temporary and survivable."

DR. STEVEN HAYES: [TIME ~ 01:10:30] That's excellent. In ACT, we might create what we call a "values reminder." A photo or object that represents what matters to you, kept visible when you're at these choice points.

DR. JEFFREY YOUNG: Let's talk about the long game here. Changing these patterns isn't about one day of doing chores instead of gaming. It's about gradually rewiring your brain, rebuilding your relationship with discomfort, reclaiming your agency.

DR. STEVEN HAYES: It's a process, not an event. And like any process, it has ups and downs, progress and setbacks. The trajectory matters more than any single day.

DR. JEFFREY YOUNG: And here's something hopeful – each small victory makes the next one easier. When you successfully do chores before gaming once, you've created a new neural pathway. It's weak at first, but each repetition strengthens it.

DR. STEVEN HAYES: This is neuroplasticity in action. Your brain is constantly rewiring based on your behavior. The question is: Are you consciously directing that rewiring, or is it happening on autopilot?

DR. JEFFREY YOUNG: [TIME ~ 01:13:00] Let's bring this full circle to the Schelling fence concept. The article mentions that sometimes we need to make pre-commitments to our future selves because we don't trust those future selves to make good decisions.

DR. STEVEN HAYES: It's like Odysseus tying himself to the mast to resist the Sirens. He knew that future-Odysseus, hearing the Sirens' song, wouldn't be able to resist. So present-Odysseus took away future-Odysseus's ability to choose.

DR. JEFFREY YOUNG: In practical terms, this might mean setting up automatic transfers to savings so you can't spend the money, or in our case, using parental controls on your gaming system that lock you out during certain hours.

DR. STEVEN HAYES: The key is doing this from a place of self-compassion, not self-punishment. You're not saying "I'm weak and can't be trusted." You're saying "I'm human, and I'm setting myself up for success."

DR. JEFFREY YOUNG: Exactly. In schema therapy, we frame this as your Healthy Adult taking care of your Vulnerable Child. You're creating structure and boundaries because you care about yourself, not because you're bad or weak.

DR. STEVEN HAYES: [TIME ~ 01:15:30] As we start to wrap up, I want to emphasize something crucial. This work – changing patterns, facing discomfort, acting according to values – it's some of the hardest work a human can do. If someone is struggling with this, they're not alone, and they're not weak.

DR. JEFFREY YOUNG: Absolutely. These patterns often develop over years or decades. They're serving some function, meeting some need, even if imperfectly. Changing them requires courage, patience, and usually support.

DR. STEVEN HAYES: And it's worth it. On the other side of this work is a life of greater vitality, authenticity, and meaning. Not a life without gaming – gaming can absolutely be part of a valued life – but a life where gaming is a choice, not a compulsion.

DR. JEFFREY YOUNG: A life where you're the author of your own story, not a character being pushed around by your modes or your thoughts or your feelings.

DR. STEVEN HAYES: So for our listener who's sitting there right now, maybe with a pile of chores and a strong urge to boot up Civ VI, what's our final message?

DR. JEFFREY YOUNG: [TIME ~ 01:17:45] Start small. Pick one tiny chore. Do it mindfully, fully present. Notice any discomfort that arises and breathe through it. Then celebrate – you just did something incredibly difficult and important.

DR. STEVEN HAYES: And remember, this moment – right now – is a choice point. You can choose to step toward your values or away from them. Either way, be kind to yourself. Tomorrow you'll have another choice point, and another chance.

DR. JEFFREY YOUNG: Jeff, this has been such a rich conversation. The integration of ACT principles, schema therapy, and this concept of Schelling fences really illuminates the complexity of what seems like a simple problem.

DR. STEVEN HAYES: It really does. And I think what's beautiful is that all these approaches are ultimately pointing to the same thing – the human capacity for conscious choice, even in the face of strong impulses and difficult emotions.

DR. JEFFREY YOUNG: That capacity is always there, sometimes buried under layers of conditioning and habit, but always accessible. That's the hope we want to leave people with.

DR. STEVEN HAYES: [TIME ~ 01:19:30] Before we close, let's acknowledge something. We've been talking about Civilization VI, but this pattern applies to so many areas of life. Social media scrolling, Netflix binging, online shopping – any activity that provides immediate mood improvement at the cost of avoiding important tasks.

DR. JEFFREY YOUNG: The principles we've discussed apply across the board. Recognize the pattern, understand what need it's meeting, find healthier ways to meet that need, and gradually build your capacity to act according to your values rather than your impulses.

DR. STEVEN HAYES: And remember that perfection isn't the goal. You don't need to become someone who loves doing chores or never wants to game. You just need to become someone who can choose consciously, who can tolerate discomfort when necessary, who can act according to their deeper values.

DR. JEFFREY YOUNG: That's a beautiful place to end. Thank you, Steve, for this conversation. And thank you to our listeners for joining us on this exploration.

DR. STEVEN HAYES: Thank you, Jeff. And to our listener struggling with that pile of chores and that tempting game of Civ VI – we see you, we've been there, and we believe in your capacity to choose the life you want to live.

**[OUTRO MUSIC: Soft, contemplative piano fades in]**

DR. STEVEN HAYES: [TIME ~ 01:21:00] This has been a conversation between myself, Steven Hayes, and Dr. Jeffrey Young, exploring the intersection of ACT, Schema Therapy, and behavioral economics in understanding everyday struggles with procrastination and mood regulation. Remember, the path to psychological flexibility isn't about perfection – it's about awareness, choice, and compassion. Until next time, may you find the courage to face discomfort in service of what matters to you.
